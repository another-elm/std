Quick Installation Guide for another-elm/std
============================================

Contributions are very welcome, currently we do not have any explicit
guidelines.

Getting started
---------------

After cloning the repository run `$ ./x.py install` which will install some
dependencies and check other dependencies are installed. If it runs
successfully you should be good to go.

Tools

- `$ ./x.py tidy` runs formatting and automatic eslint fixing.
- `$ ./x.py check` runs all the static analysis tools we have.
- `$ ./init.py cd tests && elm-test --compiler ../another-elm` runs unit tests.
  We will hopefully get a nice python sub-command for testing soon.

Acknowledgements
----------------

The vast majority of the code in another-elm is derived from the relevant elm/*
packages.

The documentation of another-elm is inspired by that of [musl].
