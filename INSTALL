Quick Installation Guide for musl libc
======================================


another-elm comes with a wrapper script of the same name. The wrapper should be
a drop in replacement for the offical elm compiler.


Prerequisites
-------------

The wrapper script is written in python, a non-eol needs to be installed to run
the wrapper. The official elm compiler must also be installed.


Supported Elm Versions
----------------------

We support the latest version of elm, older versions may be supported but that
support may be removed at any time.


Build and Installation Procedure
--------------------------------

To build and install another-elm:

   sudo mkdir -p /opt/elm/
   sudo chown $USER /opt/elm
   git clone https://github.com/another-elm/std /opt/elm/std
   sudo ln -s /opt/elm/std/tools/another-elm /usr/local/bin/another-elm


Checking for Successful Installation
------------------------------------

Currently it is hard to work out if the installation worked correctly. In the
future we will automate this. For now, here is a usefull test: if the compiler
generates javascript contains "$elm$core$Platform$Raw$Scheduler" then
another-elm has been correctly installed.
