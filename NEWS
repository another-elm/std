A sort of inline blog for updates about this core libary

## 2020/04/26 - the future?

I wan't to move to away from callbacks and towards async/await and promises (or
futures). Firstly, I find that async/await is much easier to reason about than
callbacks and leads to much prettier code. Also, in the back of my mind is the
desire to eventually port the core libraries to rust for native compiled elm
code.

Todays change is just cosmetic, but hopefully is step 1.
