     another-elm/core

Another implementation of the elm core library.

To read about the development of this library see ./NEWS which hopefully
chronicles the most important developments.

We will leave you with Tom Odell's `Another elm':

    And I'd sing a song, that'd be just ours
    But I sang 'em all to another heart
    And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love
    But all my pull-requests got batched

    On another elm, another elm
    All my tears have been used up
    On another elm, another elm
    All my tears have been used up
    On another elm, another elm
    All my tears have been used up
