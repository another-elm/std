To play with these examples locally, you need to (1) make sure Elm is [installed](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) and then (2) run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elm/file.git
cd file/examples
elm reactor
```

You can then play with the working examples at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

**Note:** You may need to open up the “Network” panel in your browser’s developer tools and slow down the network speed to get the progress examples to animate nicely!
