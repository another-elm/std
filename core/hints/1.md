# Problem

The application you are using ran into a problem.

If you let their support team know about this error, please give them a link to this web page as well!

## Info for Developers

The application transitioned to a new URL, but the `Url.Parser.toUrl` function could not handle it. It probably is an unsupported URL like a `file://` or `data://` URL but it may be a bug in the [`elm-lang/url`][url] package. Explore more and report an [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) if you can definitively show it is a bug.

You can get more detailed information if you can reproduce the error in dev mode.

Hopefully that helps!
