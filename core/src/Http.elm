-- REQUESTS


{-| Create a `GET` request.

    import Http

    type Msg
        = GotText (Result Http.Error String)

    getPublicOpinion : Cmd Msg
    getPublicOpinion =
        Http.get
            { url = "https://elm-lang.org/assets/public-opinion.txt"
            , expect = Http.expectString GotText
            }

You can use functions like [`expectString`](#expectString) and
[`expectJson`](#expectJson) to interpret the response in different ways. In
this example, we are expecting the response body to be a `String` containing
the full text of _Public Opinion_Â by Walter Lippmann.

**Note:** Use [`elm/url`](/packages/elm/url/latest) to build reliable URLs.

-}
get :
    { url : String
    , expect : Expect msg
    }
    -> Cmd msg
get r =
    request
        { method = "GET"
        , headers = []
        , url = r.url
        , body = emptyBody
        , expect = r.expect
        , timeout = Nothing
        , tracker = Nothing
        }


{-| Create a `POST` request. So imagine we want to send a POST request for
some JSON data. It might look like this:

    import Http
    import Json.Decode exposing (list, string)

    type Msg
        = GotBooks (Result Http.Error (List String))

    postBooks : Cmd Msg
    postBooks =
        Http.post
            { url = "https://example.com/books"
            , body = Http.emptyBody
            , expect = Http.expectJson GotBooks (list string)
            }

Notice that we are using [`expectJson`](#expectJson) to interpret the response
as JSON. You can learn more about how JSON decoders work [here] in the guide.

We did not put anything in the body of our request, but you can use functions
like [`stringBody`](#stringBody) and [`jsonBody`](#jsonBody) if you need to
send information to the server.

[here]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/json.html

-}
post :
    { url : String
    , body : Body
    , expect : Expect msg
    }
    -> Cmd msg
post r =
    request
        { method = "POST"
        , headers = []
        , url = r.url
        , body = r.body
        , expect = r.expect
        , timeout = Nothing
        , tracker = Nothing
        }


{-| Create a custom request. For example, a PUT for files might look like this:

    import File
    import Http

    type Msg
        = Uploaded (Result Http.Error ())

    upload : File.File -> Cmd Msg
    upload file =
        Http.request
            { method = "PUT"
            , headers = []
            , url = "https://example.com/publish"
            , body = Http.fileBody file
            , expect = Http.expectWhatever Uploaded
            , timeout = Nothing
            , tracker = Nothing
            }

It lets you set custom `headers` as needed. The `timeout` is the number of
milliseconds you are willing to wait before giving up. The `tracker` lets you
[`cancel`](#cancel) and [`track`](#track) requests.

-}
request :
    { method : String
    , headers : List Header
    , url : String
    , body : Body
    , expect : Expect msg
    , timeout : Maybe Float
    , tracker : Maybe String
    }
    -> Cmd msg
request r =
    requestHelp r FromThisDomainOnly



-- HEADERS


{-| An HTTP header for configuring requests. See a bunch of common headers
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields).
-}
type Header
    = Header String String


{-| Create a `Header`.

    header "If-Modified-Since" "Sat 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT"

    header "Max-Forwards" "10"

    header "X-Requested-With" "XMLHttpRequest"

-}
header : String -> String -> Header
header =
    Header



-- BODY


{-| Represents the body of a `Request`.
-}
type Body
    = Body (Maybe String) RequestBodyContents


{-| Create an empty body for your `Request`. This is useful for GET requests
and POST requests where you are not sending any data.
-}
emptyBody : Body
emptyBody =
    Body Nothing emptyBodyContents


{-| Put some JSON value in the body of your `Request`.

Maybe you want to search for 10 books relevant to a certain topic:

    import Http
    import Json.Encode as E

    searchForBooks : String -> Cmd Msg
    searchForBooks topic =
        Http.post
            { url = "https://api.example.com/books"
            , body =
                Http.jsonBody <|
                    E.object
                        [ ( "topic", E.string topic )
                        , ( "limit", E.int 10 )
                        ]
            , expect =
                Http.expectJson GotBooks booksDecoder
            }

**Note:** This will automatically add the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

-}
jsonBody : Encode.Value -> Body
jsonBody value =
    Body (Just "application/json") (stringBodyContents (Encode.encode 0 value))


{-| Put some string in the body of your `Request`. Defining `jsonBody` looks
like this:

    import Json.Encode as Encode

    jsonBody : Encode.Value -> Body
    jsonBody value =
        stringBody "application/json" (Encode.encode 0 value)

The first argument is a [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)
of the body. Some servers are strict about this!

-}
stringBody : String -> String -> Body
stringBody mimeType body =
    Body (Just mimeType) (stringBodyContents body)


{-| Put some `Bytes` in the body of your `Request`. This allows you to use
[`elm/bytes`](/packages/elm/bytes/latest) to have full control over the binary
representation of the data you are sending. For example, you could create an
`archive.zip` file and send it along like this:

    import Bytes exposing (Bytes)

    zipBody : Bytes -> Body
    zipBody bytes =
        bytesBody "application/zip" bytes

The first argument is a [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)
of the body. In other scenarios you may want to use MIME types like `image/png`
or `image/jpeg` instead.

**Note:** Use [`track`](#track) to track upload progress.

-}
bytesBody : String -> Bytes -> Body
bytesBody mimeType body =
    Body (Just mimeType) (bytesBodyContents body)


{-| Use a file as the body of your `Request`. When someone uploads an image
into the browser with [`elm/file`](/packages/elm/file/latest) you can forward
it to a server.

This will automatically set the `Content-Type` to the MIME type of the file.

**Note:** Use [`track`](#track) to track upload progress.

-}
fileBody : File -> Body
fileBody file =
    Body Nothing (fileBodyContents file)



-- PARTS


{-| When someone clicks submit on the `<form>`, browsers send a special HTTP
request with all the form data. Something like this:

    POST /test.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.org
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary="7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW"

    --7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

    Trip to London
    --7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="album[]"; filename="parliment.jpg"

    ...RAW...IMAGE...BITS...
    --7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--

This was the only way to send files for a long time, so many servers expect
data in this format. **The `multipartBody` function lets you create these
requests.** For example, to upload a photo album all at once, you could create
a body like this:

    multipartBody
        [ stringPart "title" "Trip to London"
        , filePart "album[]" file1
        , filePart "album[]" file2
        , filePart "album[]" file3
        ]

All of the body parts need to have a name. Names can be repeated. Adding the
`[]` on repeated names is a convention from PHP. It seems weird, but I see it
enough to mention it. You do not have to do it that way, especially if your
server uses some other convention!

The `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` header is automatically set when
creating a body this way.

**Note:** Use [`track`](#track) to track upload progress.

-}
multipartBody : List Part -> Body
multipartBody parts =
    Body Nothing (multipartBodyContents parts)


{-| One part of a `multipartBody`.
-}
type Part
    = Part String PartContents


{-| A part that contains `String` data.

    multipartBody
        [ stringPart "title" "Tom"
        , filePart "photo" tomPng
        ]

-}
stringPart : String -> String -> Part
stringPart name value =
    Part name (stringPartContents value)


{-| A part that contains a file. You can use
[`elm/file`](/packages/elm/file/latest) to get files loaded into the
browser. From there, you can send it along to a server like this:

    multipartBody
        [ stringPart "product" "Ikea Bekant"
        , stringPart "description" "Great desk for home office."
        , filePart "image[]" file1
        , filePart "image[]" file2
        , filePart "image[]" file3
        ]

-}
filePart : String -> File -> Part
filePart name file =
    Part name (filePartContents file)


{-| A part that contains bytes, allowing you to use
[`elm/bytes`](/packages/elm/bytes/latest) to encode data exactly in the format
you need.

    multipartBody
        [ stringPart "title" "Tom"
        , bytesPart "photo" "image/png" bytes
        ]

**Note:** You must provide a MIME type so that the receiver has clues about
how to interpret the bytes.

-}
bytesPart : String -> String -> Bytes -> Part
bytesPart key mime bytes =
    Part key (bytesToBlob mime bytes)



-- EXPECT


{-| Logic for interpreting a response body.
-}
type Expect msg
    = Expect (BodyInterpretter ResponseBodyContents msg)


{-| Expect the response body to be a `String`. Like when getting the full text
of a book:

    import Http

    type Msg
        = GotText (Result Http.Error String)

    getPublicOpinion : Cmd Msg
    getPublicOpinion =
        Http.get
            { url = "https://elm-lang.org/assets/public-opinion.txt"
            , expect = Http.expectString GotText
            }

The response body is always some sequence of bytes, but in this case, we
expect it to be UTF-8 encoded text that can be turned into a `String`.

-}
expectString : (Result Error String -> msg) -> Expect msg
expectString toMsg =
    expectStringResponse toMsg (resolve Ok)


{-| Expect the response body to be JSON. Like if you want to get a random cat
GIF you might say:

    import Http
    import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, string)

    type Msg
        = GotGif (Result Http.Error String)

    getRandomCatGif : Cmd Msg
    getRandomCatGif =
        Http.get
            { url = "https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&tag=cat"
            , expect = Http.expectJson GotGif gifDecoder
            }

    gifDecoder : Decoder String
    gifDecoder =
        field "data" (field "image_url" string)

The official guide goes through this particular example [here]. That page
also introduces [`elm/json`][json] to help you get started turning JSON into
Elm values in other situations.

[here]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/json.html
[json]: /packages/elm/json/latest/

If the JSON decoder fails, you get a `BadBody` error that tries to explain
what went wrong.

-}
expectJson : (Result Error a -> msg) -> Decode.Decoder a -> Expect msg
expectJson toMsg decoder =
    expectStringResponse toMsg <|
        resolve <|
            \string ->
                Result.mapError Decode.errorToString (Decode.decodeString decoder string)


{-| Expect the response body to be binary data. For example, maybe you are
talking to an endpoint that gives back ProtoBuf data:

    import Bytes.Decode as Bytes
    import Http

    type Msg
        = GotData (Result Http.Error Data)

    getData : Cmd Msg
    getData =
        Http.get
            { url = "/data"
            , expect = Http.expectBytes GotData dataDecoder
            }

    -- dataDecoder : Bytes.Decoder Data

You would use [`elm/bytes`](/packages/elm/bytes/latest/) to decode the binary
data according to a proto definition file like `example.proto`.

If the decoder fails, you get a `BadBody` error that just indicates that
_something_ went wrong. It probably makes sense to debug by peeking at the
bytes you are getting in the browser developer tools or something.

-}
expectBytes : (Result Error a -> msg) -> Bytes.Decoder a -> Expect msg
expectBytes toMsg decoder =
    expectBytesResponse toMsg <|
        resolve <|
            \bytes ->
                Result.fromMaybe "unexpected bytes" (Bytes.decode decoder bytes)


{-| Expect the response body to be whatever. It does not matter. Ignore it!
For example, you might want this when uploading files:

    import Http

    type Msg
        = Uploaded (Result Http.Error ())

    upload : File -> Cmd Msg
    upload file =
        Http.post
            { url = "/upload"
            , body = Http.fileBody file
            , expect = Http.expectWhatever Uploaded
            }

The server may be giving back a response body, but we do not care about it.

-}
expectWhatever : (Result Error () -> msg) -> Expect msg
expectWhatever toMsg =
    expectBytesResponse toMsg (resolve (\_ -> Ok ()))


resolve : (body -> Result String a) -> Response body -> Result Error a
resolve toResult response =
    case response of
        BadUrl_ url ->
            Err (BadUrl url)

        Timeout_ ->
            Err Timeout

        NetworkError_ ->
            Err NetworkError

        BadStatus_ metadata _ ->
            Err (BadStatus metadata.statusCode)

        GoodStatus_ _ body ->
            Result.mapError BadBody (toResult body)


{-| A `Request` can fail in a couple ways:

  - `BadUrl` means you did not provide a valid URL.
  - `Timeout` means it took too long to get a response.
  - `NetworkError` means the user turned off their wifi, went in a cave, etc.
  - `BadStatus` means you got a response back, but the status code indicates failure.
  - `BadBody` means you got a response back with a nice status code, but the body
    of the response was something unexpected. The `String` in this case is a
    debugging message that explains what went wrong with your JSON decoder or
    whatever.

**Note:** You can use [`expectStringResponse`](#expectStringResponse) and
[`expectBytesResponse`](#expectBytesResponse) to get more flexibility on this.

-}
type Error
    = BadUrl String
    | Timeout
    | NetworkError
    | BadStatus Int
    | BadBody String



-- ELABORATE EXPECTATIONS


{-| Expect a [`Response`](#Response) with a `String` body. So you could define
your own [`expectJson`](#expectJson) like this:

    import Http
    import Json.Decode as D

    expectJson : (Result Http.Error a -> msg) -> D.Decoder a -> Expect msg
    expectJson toMsg decoder =
        expectStringResponse toMsg <|
            \response ->
                case response of
                    Http.BadUrl_ url ->
                        Err (Http.BadUrl url)

                    Http.Timeout_ ->
                        Err Http.Timeout

                    Http.NetworkError_ ->
                        Err Http.NetworkError

                    Http.BadStatus_ metadata body ->
                        Err (Http.BadStatus metadata.statusCode)

                    Http.GoodStatus_ metadata body ->
                        case D.decodeString decoder body of
                            Ok value ->
                                Ok value

                            Err err ->
                                Err (Http.BadBody (D.errorToString err))

This function is great for fancier error handling and getting response headers.
For example, maybe when your sever gives a 404 status code (not found) it also
provides a helpful JSON message in the response body. This function lets you
add logic to the `BadStatus_` branch so you can parse that JSON and give users
a more helpful message! Or make your own custom error type for your particular
application!

-}
expectStringResponse : (Result x a -> msg) -> (Response String -> Result x a) -> Expect msg
expectStringResponse toMsg toResult =
    stringBodyInterpretter (toResult >> toMsg)
        |> hideInterpretterInternalType
        |> Expect


{-| Expect a [`Response`](#Response) with a `Bytes` body.

It works just like [`expectStringResponse`](#expectStringResponse), giving you
more access to headers and more leeway in defining your own errors.

-}
expectBytesResponse : (Result x a -> msg) -> (Response Bytes -> Result x a) -> Expect msg
expectBytesResponse toMsg toResult =
    bytesBodyInterpretter (toResult >> toMsg)
        |> hideInterpretterInternalType
        |> Expect


{-| A `Response` can come back a couple different ways:

  - `BadUrl_` &mdash; you did not provide a valid URL.
  - `Timeout_` &mdash; it took too long to get a response.
  - `NetworkError_` &mdash; the user turned off their wifi, went in a cave, etc.
  - `BadStatus_` &mdash; a response arrived, but the status code indicates failure.
  - `GoodStatus_` &mdash; a response arrived with a nice status code!

The type of the `body` depends on whether you use
[`expectStringResponse`](#expectStringResponse)
or [`expectBytesResponse`](#expectBytesResponse).

-}
type Response body
    = BadUrl_ String
    | Timeout_
    | NetworkError_
    | BadStatus_ Metadata body
    | GoodStatus_ Metadata body


{-| Extra information about the response:

  - `url` of the server that actually responded (so you can detect redirects)
  - `statusCode` like `200` or `404`
  - `statusText` describing what the `statusCode` means a little
  - `headers` like `Content-Length` and `Expires`

**Note:** It is possible for a response to have the same header multiple times.
In that case, all the values end up in a single entry in the `headers`
dictionary. The values are separated by commas, following the rules outlined
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4371328/are-duplicate-http-response-headers-acceptable).

-}
type alias Metadata =
    { url : String
    , statusCode : Int
    , statusText : String
    , headers : Dict String String
    }



-- CANCEL


{-| Try to cancel an ongoing request based on a `tracker`.
-}
cancel : String -> Cmd msg
cancel tracker =
    command
        (\runtimeId ->
            Impure.fromFunction (cancel_ runtimeId) tracker
                |> Impure.map (\() -> Nothing)
                |> RawTask.execImpure
        )



-- PROGRESS


{-| Track the progress of a request. Create a [`request`](#request) where
`tracker = Just "form.pdf"` and you can track it with a subscription like
`track "form.pdf" GotProgress`.
-}
track : String -> (Progress -> msg) -> Sub msg
track tracker toMsg =
    subscription tracker (toMsg >> Just)


{-| There are two phases to HTTP requests. First you **send** a bunch of data,
then you **receive** a bunch of data. For example, say you use `fileBody` to
upload a file of 262144 bytes. From there, progress will go like this:

    Sending { sent = 0, size = 262144 } -- 0.0

    Sending { sent = 65536, size = 262144 } -- 0.25

    Sending { sent = 131072, size = 262144 } -- 0.5

    Sending { sent = 196608, size = 262144 } -- 0.75

    Sending { sent = 262144, size = 262144 } -- 1.0

    Receiving { received = 0, size = Just 16 } -- 0.0

    Receiving { received = 16, size = Just 16 } -- 1.0

With file uploads, the **send** phase is expensive. That is what we saw in our
example. But with file downloads, the **receive** phase is expensive.

Use [`fractionSent`](#fractionSent) and [`fractionReceived`](#fractionReceived)
to turn this progress information into specific fractions!

**Note:** The `size` of the response is based on the [`Content-Length`][cl]
header, and in rare and annoying cases, a server may not include that header.
That is why the `size` is a `Maybe Int` in `Receiving`.

[cl]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length

-}
type Progress
    = Sending { sent : Int, size : Int }
    | Receiving { received : Int, size : Maybe Int }


{-| Turn `Sending` progress into a useful fraction.

    fractionSent { sent =   0, size = 1024 } == 0.0
    fractionSent { sent = 256, size = 1024 } == 0.25
    fractionSent { sent = 512, size = 1024 } == 0.5

    -- fractionSent { sent = 0, size = 0 } == 1.0

The result is always between `0.0` and `1.0`, ensuring that any progress bar
animations never go out of bounds.

And notice that `size` can be zero. That means you are sending a request with
an empty body. Very common! When `size` is zero, the result is always `1.0`.

**Note:** If you create your own function to compute this fraction, watch out
for divide-by-zero errors!

-}
fractionSent : { sent : Int, size : Int } -> Float
fractionSent p =
    if p.size == 0 then
        1

    else
        clamp 0 1 (toFloat p.sent / toFloat p.size)


{-| Turn `Receiving` progress into a useful fraction for progress bars.

    fractionReceived { received =   0, size = Just 1024 } == 0.0
    fractionReceived { received = 256, size = Just 1024 } == 0.25
    fractionReceived { received = 512, size = Just 1024 } == 0.5

    -- fractionReceived { received =   0, size = Nothing } == 0.0
    -- fractionReceived { received = 256, size = Nothing } == 0.0
    -- fractionReceived { received = 512, size = Nothing } == 0.0

The `size` here is based on the [`Content-Length`][cl] header which may be
missing in some cases. A server may be misconfigured or it may be streaming
data and not actually know the final size. Whatever the case, this function
will always give `0.0` when the final size is unknown.

Furthermore, the `Content-Length` header may be incorrect! The implementation
clamps the fraction between `0.0` and `1.0`, so you will just get `1.0` if
you ever receive more bytes than promised.

**Note:** If you are streaming something, you can write a custom version of
this function that just tracks bytes received. Maybe you show that 22kb or 83kb
have been downloaded, without a specific fraction. If you do this, be wary of
divide-by-zero errors because `size` can always be zero!

-- CUSTOM REQUESTS


{-| Create a request with a risky security policy. Things like:

  - Allow responses from other domains to set cookies.
  - Include cookies in requests to other domains.

This is called [`withCredentials`][wc] in JavaScript, and it allows a couple
other risky things as well. It can be useful if `www.example.com` needs to
talk to `uploads.example.com`, but it should be used very carefully!

For example, every HTTP request includes a `Origin` header revealing the domain,
so any request to `facebook.com` reveals the website that sent it. From there,
cookies can be used to correlate browsing habits with specific users. âOh, it
looks like they visited `example.com`. Maybe they want ads about examples!â
This is why you can get shoe ads for months without saying anything about it
on any social networks. **This risk exists even for people who do not have an
account.** Servers can set a new cookie to uniquely identify the browser and
build a profile around that. Same kind of tricks for logged out users.

**Context:** A significantly worse version of this can happen when trying to
add integrations with Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, etc. âAdd our share
button. It is super easy. Just add this `<script>` tag!â But the goal here is
to get _arbitrary_ access to the executing context. Now they can track clicks,
read page content, use time zones to approximate location, etc. As of this
writing, suggesting that developers just embed `<script>` tags is the default
for Google Analytics, Facebook Like Buttons, Twitter Follow Buttons, Pinterest
Save Buttons, and Instagram Embeds.
