{-| This library fills a bunch of important niches in Elm. A `Maybe` can help
you with optional arguments, error handling, and records with optional fields.

import Basics exposing (Bool(..))


{-| Represent values that may or may not exist. It can be useful if you have a
record field that is only filled in sometimes. Or if a function takes a value
sometimes, but does not absolutely need it.

    -- A person, but maybe we do not know their age.
    type alias Person =
        { name : String
        , age : Maybe Int
        }

    tom =
        { name = "Tom", age = Just 42 }

    sue =
        { name = "Sue", age = Nothing }

-}
type Maybe a
    = Just a
    | Nothing


{-| Provide a default value, turning an optional value into a normal
value. This comes in handy when paired with functions like
[`Dict.get`](Dict#get) which gives back a `Maybe`.

    withDefault 100 (Just 42) -- 42

    withDefault 100 Nothing -- 100

    withDefault "unknown" (Dict.get "Tom" Dict.empty) -- "unknown"

**Note:** This can be overused! Many cases are better handled by a `case`
expression. And if you end up using `withDefault` a lot, it can be a good sign
that a [custom type][ct] will clean your code up quite a bit!

{-| Chain together many computations that may fail. It is helpful to see its
definition:

    andThen : (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
    andThen callback maybe =
        case maybe of
            Just value ->
                callback value

            Nothing ->
                Nothing

This means we only continue with the callback if things are going well. For
example, say you need to parse some user input as a month:

    parseMonth : String -> Maybe Int
    parseMonth userInput =
        String.toInt userInput
            |> andThen toValidMonth

    toValidMonth : Int -> Maybe Int
    toValidMonth month =
        if 1 <= month && month <= 12 then
            Just month

        else
            Nothing

In the `parseMonth` function, if `String.toInt` produces `Nothing` (because
the `userInput` was not an integer) this entire chain of operations will
short-circuit and result in `Nothing`. If `toValidMonth` results in `Nothing`,
again the chain of computations will result in `Nothing`.
