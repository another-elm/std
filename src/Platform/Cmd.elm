-- COMMANDS


{-| A command is a way of telling Elm, “Hey, I want you to do this thing!”
So if you want to send an HTTP request, you would need to command Elm to do it.
Or if you wanted to ask for geolocation, you would need to command Elm to go
get it.

Every `Cmd` specifies (1) which effects you need access to and (2) the type of
messages that will come back into your application.

**Note:** Do not worry if this seems confusing at first! As with every Elm user
ever, commands will make more sense as you work through [the Elm Architecture
Tutorial](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) and see how they
fit into a real application!
-}
type Cmd msg =
  Value (Platform.Bag.Bag msg)


{-| Tell the runtime that there are no commands.

-}
none : Cmd msg
none =
  batch []


{-| When you need the runtime system to perform a couple commands, you
can batch them together. Each is handed to the runtime at the same time,
and since each can perform arbitrary operations in the world, there are
no ordering guarantees about the results.

**Note:** `Cmd.none` and `Cmd.batch [ Cmd.none, Cmd.none ]` and `Cmd.batch []`
all do the same thing.
-}
batch : List (Cmd msg) -> Cmd msg
batch =
  List.map (\(Value bag) -> bag)
    >> Platform.Bag.batch
    >> Value



-- FANCY STUFF


{-| Transform the messages produced by a command.
Very similar to [`Html.map`](/packages/elm/html/latest/Html#map).

This is very rarely useful in well-structured Elm code, so definitely read the
section on [structure][] in the guide before reaching for this!

map : (a -> msg) -> Cmd a -> Cmd msg
map fn (Value bag) =
  Value (Platform.Bag.map fn bag)
