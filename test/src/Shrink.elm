{-| Library containing a collection of basic shrinkers and helper functions to

Shrinking is part of fuzzing, and the provided fuzzers have shrinkers already
built into them. You really only have to write your own shrinkers if you use
`Fuzz.custom`.

## What are Shrinkers and why do we need them?

Fuzzers consist of two parts; a Generator and a Shrinker.

The Generator takes a random Seed as input and returns a random value of
the desired type, based on the Seed. When a test fails on one of those random
values, the shrinker takes the failing value and makes it smaller/simpler for
you so you can guess more easily what property of that value caused the test
to fail.

Shrinking is a way to try and find the "smallest", "simplest" example that
fails, in order to give the tester better feedback on what went wrong.

Shrinkers are functions that, given a failing value, offer "smaller", "simpler"
values to test against.


### What is "small" (or "simple")?

That's kind of arbitrary, and depends on what kind of values you're fuzzing.
When you write your own Shrinker, you decide what is small for the kind of data
you're testing with.

Let's say I'm writing a Fuzzer for binary trees:

    -- randomly-generated binary trees might soon become unreadable
    type Tree a
        = Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
        | Leaf a

Now let's say its random Generator produced the following tree that makes the
test fail:

    Node
        (Node
            (Node
                (Node
                    (Leaf 888)
                    (Leaf 9090)
                )
                (Node
                    (Leaf -1)
                    (Node
                        (Leaf 731)
                        (Node
                            (Leaf 9621)
                            (Leaf -12)
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
            (Node
                (Leaf -350)
                (Leaf 124)
            )
        )
        (Node
            (Leaf 45)
            (Node
                (Leaf 123)
                (Node
                    (Leaf 999111)
                    (Leaf -148148)
                )
            )
        )

This is a pretty big tree, there are many nodes and leaves, and it's difficult
to tell which is responsible for the failing. If we don't attempt to shrink it,
the developer will have a hard time pointing out why it fails.

Now let's pass it through a shrinker, and test the resulting value until we find
this new value that still fails the test:

    Leaf -1

Nice, looks like a negative number in a `Leaf` could be the issue.


### How does shrinking work?

A shrinker takes a value and returns a short list of smaller values.

Once elm-test finds a failing fuzz test, it tries to shrink the input using
the shrinker. We'll then try the smaller values as inputs to that test. If one
of the smaller values also fail, we continue shrinking from there instead.
Once the shrinker says that there are no smaller values, or no smaller values
fail the fuzz test, we stop shrinking.

It's helpful to think of Shrinkers as returning simpler values rather than
smaller values. For example, 1 is smaller/simpler than 47142, and -1 is
smaller/simpler than -47142.

Whether or not the shrunken value is actually smaller isn't that important,
as long as we aren't shrinking in a loop. The bool shrinker shrinks True to
False, but not vice versa. If it did, and your test failed no matter if this
variable was True or False, there would always be a smaller/simpler value, so
we'd never stop shrinking! We would just re-test the same values over and over
again, forever!


### How do I make my own Shrinkers?

Shrinkers are deterministic, since they do not have access to a random number
generator. It's the generator part of the fuzzer that's meant to find the rare
edge cases; it's the shrinkers job to make the failures as understandable as
possible.

Shrinkers have to return a LazyList, something that works a bit like a list.
That LazyList may or may not have another element each time we ask for one,
and doesn't necessarily have them all committed to memory. That allows it to
take less space (interesting since there may be quite a lot of elements).

That LazyList should also provide a finite number of shrunk values (if it
provided an infinite number of them, tests using it might continue indefinitely
at the shrinking phase).

Shrinkers must never shrink values in a circle, like:

    loopinBooleanShrinker True == [ False ]

    loopinBooleanShrinker False == [ True ]

Doing so will also result in tests looping indefinitely, testing and re-testing
the same values in a circle.
